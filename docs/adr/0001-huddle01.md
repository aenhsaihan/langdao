# ADR-0001: ~~Choose Huddle01~~ Use Custom WebRTC for Live Sessions

> **Status:** SUPERSEDED - Huddle01 did not work for our use case. We implemented a custom WebRTC solution instead.

## Original Context

We need decentralized, wallet-aware live sessions that feel native to Web3.

## Original Decision

~~Adopt **Huddle01** as the video layer for MVP.~~

## What Actually Happened

Huddle01 integration did not work as expected. We built a custom WebRTC implementation instead.

## Actual Implementation

- **Custom WebRTC server** in `backend/webRTC-implementation-LangDAO/`
- Peer-to-peer video/audio calls
- Session monitoring and disconnect detection
- Direct integration with our backend for session lifecycle management

## Rationale for Custom Solution

- More control over session lifecycle
- Easier integration with our payment system
- Better disconnect detection for auto-ending sessions
- Simpler to debug and maintain

## Consequences

- ✅ Full control over video infrastructure
- ✅ Tight integration with session management
- ✅ Reliable disconnect detection
- ⚠️ More code to maintain (but worth it)
- ⚠️ Need to handle scaling ourselves

## Future Considerations

- Evaluate recording capabilities
- Add moderation features
- Consider TURN servers for better connectivity
- Monitor performance and scale limits
